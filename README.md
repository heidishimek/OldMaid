# OldMaid

0. Name

1. Special instructions on how to run your program if it does now have any appropriate info for the user.
	
	I don't think there is any! It runs the same as the example, without a beautiful layout :(


2. What does or does not work.
	
	Everything works. Plays until the Old Maid is the only card left. There's some stuff I didn't end up using but didn't take it out for the fear that everything wouldn't work again!!


3. Anything you want the grader to know.
	
	I changed the cardStack file and added toStringWithIndex() which displays the card with the index for the user to choose. There's two outputs, one that displays the card and one that just shows a number (as if you were playing Old Maid with people!)
	Feel free to uncomment/comment to see. 


4. What part took you the longest to implement 

	Figuring out how to add the index and be able to choose the index as the user input. 


5. Time and date you finished the program.
